===== Command Structure =======================================================
Most commands and tools follow the general format:

	command_name [options] [arguments]

Example:
	echo "Hello SFSU Cybersecurity Club"
vs.
	echo -n "Hello SFSU Cybersecurity Club"

Remember, if you're unsure of what a command/tool does and how to use it you
can read its man page.
